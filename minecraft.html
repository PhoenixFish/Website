            <p>Minecraft is a game that was made a while ago using java, it uses squares through it's whole concept. It is a massive open world adevnture game with creatures and multiplayer access so you can play with friends!</p>
            <p>The main thing to do is to evolve through the different ages and gain more material to craft better items and you must gather materials to make it to the different dimensions. You must traverse the Nether and the end to complete the game.</p>
            <p>The game is very replayable as you can design anything you want and it's not all about just beating the game but the experience you have whilst playing. Even when you beat the game you can always go back and use items to do the fight again or explore the dimension more as there is an extra section after winning.</p>
            <p>Personally, I don't play it to win, I play it because there's enjoyable moments you can have with friends and also you can build whatever you like and be as creative as you want! You can make yourself overpowered, you can make structures, fight loads of mobs at once, it infinite!</p>
            <p>The game has recently updated for better graphics as a setting since it puts a lot of pressure on the processor. The graphics normally are still good and very well designed for the type of game this is. Personally, I enjoy the scenery of the game as they can produce beautiful sights with this new setting.</p>
            <p>Another good thing about the game is the multiplayer aspect, you can join a world with a friend and complete the game together or design builds together or even just mess around. You can also allow them to play while you're offline!</p>
            <p>Overall, I highly recommend this game as a random game to play and even go back to as it's always changing and there's always a different experience when you play. Playing with friends is an amazing experience as well as you can get a lot of funny experiences and build loads of structures. I hope you have/had as much fun as I have on this game.</p>
