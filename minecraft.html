        <p>Minecraft is a game that was made a while ago using java, it uses squares through it's whole concept. It is a massive open world adevnture game with creatures and multiplayer access so you can play with friends!</p>
        <p>The main thing to do is to evolve through the different ages and gain more material to craft better items and you must gather materials to make it to the different dimensions. You must traverse the Nether and the end to complete the game.</p>
        <p>Personally, I don't play it to win, I play it because there's enjoyable moments you can have with friends and also you can build whatever you like and be as creative as you want! You can make yourself overpowered, you can make structures, fight loads of mobs at once, it infinite!</p>
