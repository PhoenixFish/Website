                Grounded 2 is a enjoyable game where you are placed in a massive open world adventure map with bugs and
                insects having to fight for your life.

                Grounded is about teens who got shrunk and put into a designated place to solve hidden mysteries and
                also find out the wildlife in the area. The story is about saving an old friend and finding out who the
                mysterious person is.

                Personally, I think the game is a lot better when you first play it since you have to learn all the
                weapons, armour, utilities, etc. It definitely stays fun to play espectially when you do co-op but the
                fights are the same and the grind is the same so I feel like it can get boring. Other than that it is
                very fun to playa and understand, especially the 2nd one now since there are different classes now.
            </p>

                I chose this game as it is new and I have played the old one and new one and found both of them fun. It
                may feel like a grinding game but the different places and creatures make it fun to explore.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whilst playing this game I found that the graphics of the creatures or material was outstanding for the
                amount of detail added. Just from looking at the trailer and leaked images of the game I knew it would
                be an amazing and visually beautiful game.
            </p>
            <p>
                Playing this game with friends is an amazing experience as you get to kill bosses together, choose
                different classes and see how well they work together, change your playstyle for fighting different
                creatures together. I find it a lot more enjoyable playing with a friend. The multiplayer system can be
                a bit buggy though but you can design a world together and play when your friend is offline!
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, I find this game enjoyable and very exciting to play firsthand but I hope they add different
                approaches to their story so you can have a slight different experience whenever you play.
