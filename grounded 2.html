        <p>Grounded 2 is a enjoyable game where you are placed in a massive open world adventure map with bugs and insects having to fight for your life.</p>
        <p>Grounded is about teens who got shrunk and put into a designated place to solve hidden mysteries and also find out the wildlife in the area. The story is about saving an old friend and finding out who the mysterious person is.</p>
        <p>I chose this game as it is new and I have played the old one and new one and found both of them fun. It may feel like a grinding game but the different places and creatures make it fun to explore.</p>
