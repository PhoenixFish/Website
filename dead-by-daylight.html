            <p>Dead by Daylight has had major updates throughout it's time being out, they bring liscensed characters to the game for people to enjoy. These can be Leon Kennedy, Ellen Ripply, Chucky, Michael Myres, etc.</p>
            <p>The game features a 1v4 Killer vs Survivors where the survivors must complete a series of generators and open an exit gate once powered. Whereas, the killer must stop the survivors, hook stage them 3 time to kill them and defend the generators.</p>
            <p>Graphically the game is amazing for it's genre of horror, the fog is thick and the shadows are dark which allows for killers to sneak up on you. When playing you get the full horror experience especially with stealth killers and I find that very exciting.</p>
            <p>I chose this game because I played this a lot and it has been so much fun and addicting, you want to go off the game after a bad match but you always play another.</p>
            <p>When playing this game it's always fun and replayable since there is multiple different characters, combonations, etc to choose from. It is less likely to play against the same person you just went against so that means new playstyles and paths. I find it very enjoyable playing against a brute force killer and then having to go against a stealth killer, the change in playstyle is always fun to try.</p>
            <p>The multiplayer factor of the game is very fun with friends as you get to heat their reactions to getting scared or doing amazing tricks to get away from the killer. I highly recommend playing with a friend as it is very enjoyable especially if they are new to the game. It is also fun to learn different things with friends and use perks that synchronise with each other.</p>
            <p>Overall, I highly enjoy this game and love playing with friends and trying new things! If you feel like you want to own every emotion in 1 game then you should try this game.</p>
