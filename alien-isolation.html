                Alien isolation is a game about the Xenomorph franchise, it involves AI movement to find and challenge
                the player.

            <p>
                The players objective is to evade the Xenomorph and find answers about your characters mother or
                seperate mission depending on the gamemode.
            </p>

                The graphics of this game is amazing for the age of it, the shadows, the lighting, the scenery, the
                animations, etc is all strong and empowering. Seeing the character design of the Xenomorph seems scary
                but iconic. The kill cutscene is also graphically cool as well.

                I chose this game as it has been very enjoyable and challenging to me and it involves an aspect of
                horror which I love in videogames.
            </p>
            <p>
                The replayability of this game is very good as you've got multiple different stroylines you can follow
                and tryout. Personally I like playing as the Xenomorph and trying to complete objectives against them
                since the AI is outstanding and unpredictable sometimes.
            </p>
            <p>
                There isn't any multiplayer so you can't play with a friend but you can still compete with them for fun
                if you both own the game. If not then you can just play at the others house and compete like that.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall I would suggest trying this game out as their AI movement is quite unique and certainly
                challenging to begin with. Additionally, you could also play as a Xenomorph and try out that playstyle
                as well.
