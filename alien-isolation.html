        <p>Alien isolation is a game about the Xenomorph franchise, it involves AI movement to find and challenge the player.</p>
        <p>The players objective is to evade the Xenomorph and find answers about your characters mother or seperate mission depending on the gamemode.</p>
        <p>I chose this game as it has been very enjoyable and challenging to me and it involves an aspect of horror which I love in videogames.</p>
        <p>Overall I would suggest trying this game out as their AI movement is quite unique and certainly challenging to begin with. Additionally, you could also play as a Xenomorph and try out that playstyle as well.</p>
